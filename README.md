# Scene_MeadowEnvironment

A Digital Painting using the fantastic ["Meadow Environment - Dynamic Nature" from Nature Manufacture](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/meadow-environment-dynamic-nature-132195). This is not a free asset, but I believe it is well worth the money for anyone looking for high quality assets with which to build your own Digital Paintings.

This plugin takes the demo scene provided in the Meadow Environment package and turns it into a digital painting. It is provided as an example of how to build your own scene. See the `Assets/Digital Painting/Docs/CreateAScene.md` file for details of how it was created. The packaged scene is provided as a plugin for The Digital Painting. 

To install this scene:

  1. Create a new project
  2. Import [The Digital Painting](https://github.com/DigitalPainting/DigitalPainting) asset (and it's dependencies)
  3. Purchase and import ["Meadow Environment - Dynamic Nature" from Nature Manufacture](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/meadow-environment-dynamic-nature-132195)
  4. Double click `Assets/Digital Painting/Plugins/Scenes/Scene_MeadowEnvironment.unitypackage`
  5. Hit Play

For best results you should also add the [WeatherMaker Plugin](https://github.com/DigitalPainting/WeatherMakerPlugin) to get a Day and Night cycle and a weather system. But be warned, these plugins require the purchase of another Unity Asset - [Digital Ruby's Weather Maker](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/weather-maker-sky-weather-water-volumetric-clouds-and-light-60955).

If you would like to add support for other Unity assets in The Digital Painting we'd love to help guide you via our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/DigitalPainting/DigitalPainting/issues).
